title: Initial Post with GitHub and Jekyll
---
Over the past several months, I've found myself holding back on writing posts simply because my blog [platform](weebly.com) does not support the ability to embed code or even change fonts to resemble code, CLI, or working on a Linux terminal.  Screen shots are good, but offering the ability to copy and paste is nice, plus it just looks cleaner.  This is unacceptable.

Additionally, I have been doing much more with GitHub and markdown.  So, after reading what [Scott Lowe](http://blog.scottlowe.org/2014/12/18/blog-migration-in-the-works/) had done with his migration to Jekyll and GitHub pages, it seemed like that was a great idea. Not only should I be able to improve what I can write, I should be able to decrease the time it takes to write a post.  Awesome.  So, the journey shall begin.

Rather than harp on my existing blog platform and that it does not have an export option, I've decided not to prolong the process and make this a gradual migration.  Going forward, I will be posting [here](jedelman8.github.io) and at my existing [site](jedelman.com), but when you click the `Continue Reading...` link, you'll be redirected here.  Over time, I really hope to migrate everything to make the user experience better, but that'll take time.

Thanks
Jason
