I'll continue to update this throughout the next two days.  Feel free to issue a [pull request](https://github.com/jedelman8/jedelman8.github.com) if you're also here at the conference and want to add to this post.

## General

Location: Open Networking User Group (ONUG) at Columbia University

ONUG currently has 6 working groups:

* NSV 
* SD-WAN
* Virtual Network Overlays 
* Common Management tools across network, compute, and storage
* Network State Collection, correlation, and analytics
* Traffic Monitoring and Visibility

It is interesting and awesome to see that half of the working groups are all about Day 2 operations and management of networks.  This is exactly what's needed in the industry.

## Sessions

### Creating Business Value with Cloud Infrastructure

Speaker: Adrian Cockcroft

* Developers don't need any of that referring to NSV/NFV.
* 2009 developed the Cloudicorn, took knowledge gained to Battery
* Docker wasn't on anyone's roadmap for 2014.  It's on everyone's roadmap for 2015
* 2014 was the year that Enterpises finally embraced cloud and DevOps
* Optimizing from IT cost to delivery and speed - Nordstrom - ended up yielding lower costs
* Product IT reports into the business
* Director is the highest Corp IT title
* Immutable microservice deployments scales
* If your QA team is saying there are too many bugs in a release, you aren't releasing often enough - don't you remember "CHANGE ONE THING AT TIME".  If you are doing 6 features in 6 weeks, try 2 features in 2 weeks!
* If you haven't read the Phoenix Project, get it now and read it.
* Onto "how is that network managed" referring to a large global network with 1000s of devices?
  * SDN? Nope!
  * It's with DNS!
    * Built A tool to do an automated DNS management across multiple vendors
    * Big flat HTTP network
    * Same for public and private API access
* State of the art in networking (SDN) is VPC - this is the real competitor for Enterprise network vendors
* Adrian is interested in building on top of the public clouds and extending them (including from the perspective of network)
* Also recommends reading LEAN ENTERPRISE and Building Microservices
* Go, go, go - 80% of the projects Adrian has seen in the past 6 months have been written in go

### SD-WAN Working Group Test Results Presentation

Companies: Talari, Glue, Viptela, Cisco, Riverbed, Silver Peak, VeloCloud

* Ixia heavily involved in testing each solution
  * Co-authored test plan
  * Certified the results
  * Tests were run in vendor labs - Ixia observed remotely
* What was the testing about?
  * SD-WAN architecture diagram shown: MPLS and INTERNET into each site (multi-site topology)
  * All vendors used same test plan, design, and simulated the same types of traffic (http, voice, etc.)

**Cisco**

* Tested with ISR-4451 and CSR1000V
* Passed all tests
  *  Three items are noted in yellow
    *  Cisco does not provide app/perf stats natively- they use a 3rd party partner LiveAction to do this
    *  Northbound API is on the roadmap - but LiveAction has one that can be leveraged
    *  FIPS validation is coming soon, not there yet.

It will be interesting to see the dynamic between Cisco and GLUE going forward as GLUE has been pretty much married to Cisco providing a similar solution to what Cisco is now trying to do on their own.

**Viptela**

* Key to understand how this integrates into an existing network
* Can integrate and place Viptela vEdge devices north of the existing L2 switch or L3 device without modifying core L2/L3 functionality
* Offers virtual and physical appliances

**Glue Networks**

* Tested with ISR-4451 and CSR 1000V
* Cisco's IWAN architecture that Glue automates
* Glue automates best of breed architectures
* Operate at higher level in the stack compared to the other vendors that ran tests
* Northbound API is still pre-release
* < 2 min for full SDWAN/IWAN feature set using 3 ZTP methods

**Talari Networks**

* FIPS coming this year (nor next)
* Open northbound API coming soon
* Declined to test Zero touch deployment at branch
* Has been in this market since 2007 (before SD-WAN was a thing)

**VeloCloud**

* Tested physical and virtual appliances
* Tested dual internet and MPLS/INTERNET into physical and also MPLS/INTERNET into virtual
* As other vendors, FIPS and Northbound API were *yellow*
* Tested re-routing voice flows during brownout
  * No reset to the application
* One-click business policy
* Ensure compliance, security, and app performance

**Silver Peak**

* Focused on WAN optimization
* Accomplished this by building an overlay
* VMs are first class citizens!
* Over half of their deployments are running as VMs
* Example:  Specific policy by application such as for Office 365 vs. Facebook
* FIPS is *yellow* - future?
* Northbound API is coming as with nearly every other vendor 
* Uses IPsec for transport
* Hitless failover
* TCP sequence number stays during failover over internet/mpls links 

**Riverbed**

* Tested with Steelhead devices
* Steelhead controller is where policy is defined and pushed out from there
* FIPS is certified!!!
* Northbound API, L2/L3 interop with directly connected switch/router, CPE in p/v form factors on commodity h/w, and dynamic traffic engineering  are all *yellow*
* Offers a Python based scripting environment - SDK on GitHub

**Blows my mind so many vendors don't have the northbound API in their shipping product.**


**Nuage Networks**

* Started in DC networking, extended to the branch, announcing something new today!!
* It's the velocity of IT that really matters right now
  * Starting with Business Requirements and going through Dev/Test, Deployments, Ops, and Customer Feedback
* Dev/Test and Deployments covered in previous sessions, today the announcement is geared to Ops including Overlay and underlay correlation, service navigation, and fault management
* Nuage is talking about the Open Network Approach for assessing service health compared to the two other options: "hardware centric" and "service centric" views
* So what is the solution?
  * The route monitor - peers with the physical network AND the Correlation Engine (aggregates p + v)
  * Listens to all routing protocols updates, at least the LAYER 3 topology
  * Peers via OSPF and BGP
  * Uses SNMP to understand port status MAC table, etc.
  * Analyze faults
  * Many of the components were pulled from existing ALU SP products
* Example: Nuage agent on hypervisors listening to libvirt events

Top notch announcement by Nuage today.  Have to say the product that was presented and shown could literally be a standalone product regardless of what is deployed in the virtual and physical networks.  Great job, Nuage.  Kudos to their UI designers!
