Location: Open Networking User Group (ONUG) at Columbia University

Session: Creating Business Value with Cloud Infrastructure
Speaker: Adrian Cockcroft

* Developers don't need any of that referring to NSV/NFV.
* 2009 developed the Cloudicorn, took knowledge gained to Battery
* Docker wasn't on anyone's roadmap for 2014.  It's on everyone's roadmap for 2015
* 2014 was the year that Enterpises finally embraced cloud and DevOps
* Optimizing from IT cost to delivery and speed - Nordstrom - ended up yielding lower costs
* Product IT reports into the business
* Director is the highest Corp IT title
* Immutable microservice deployments scales
* If your QA team is saying there are too many bugs in a release, you aren't releasing often enough - don't you remember "CHANGE ONE THING AT TIME".  If you are doing 6 features in 6 weeks, try 2 features in 2 weeks!
* If you haven't read the Phoenix Project, get it now and read it.
